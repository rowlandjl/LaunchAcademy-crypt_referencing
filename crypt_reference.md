Now let's grab a few values in the `crypt_of_civilization` variable. 
Write a single line of code to answer each of the following questions:

* How many items are in the array?
* What is the first item in the array?
* What is the last item in the array?
* What is the second item in the array?
* What is the third item in the array?
* What is the second from last item in the array?
* What is the index of "Toast-O-Lator"?

{% show_solution %}

How many items are in the array:

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization.length
```

What is the first item in the array?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization[0]
```

or

```
crypt_of_civilization.first
```

What is the last item in the array?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization[-1]
crypt_of_civilization.last
```

What is the second item in the array?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization[1]
```

What is the third item in the array?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization[2]
```

What is the second from last item in the array?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization[-2]
```

What is the index of "Toast-O-Lator"?

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization.index("Toast-O-Lator")
```
